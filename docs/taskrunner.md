# Taskrunner

## Gulp

We're using [gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com) for running build tasks.

> If you have trouble using gulp you can find help on their website.

__The taskrunner is not required to use this CMS!__

There are several commands you can currently run from the command line:

* `gulp`
* `gulp watch`
* `gulp less`
* `gulp less-per-page`
* `gulp js`
* `gulp fallback`
* `gulp fonts`

> Simply running `gulp` will run all the other tasks except `gulp watch` in a row.    
> Use `gulp watch` to make gulp.js watch your filesystem for changes and run the related task.

## Bower

In order to keep all the frontend dependencies up to date we're utilizing [bower](http://bower.io).

> If you have trouble using bower you can find help on their website.
