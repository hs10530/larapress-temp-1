# Taskrunner

## Gulp

We're using [gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com) for running build tasks.

> If you have trouble using gulp you can find help on their website.

__The taskrunner is not required to use this CMS!__

There are several commands you can currently run from the command line:

* `gulp`
* `gulp less`
* `gulp less-per-page`
* `gulp js`
* `gulp fallback`
* `gulp fonts`

> Simply running `gulp` will run them altogether in a row.

__A watchtask is planned for v0.0.2__
