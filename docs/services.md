# Services

During development we've created quite a few services you could use in your custom code too.
Every Service implements an interface. Therefore we abstain from writing a documentation for each and every method.
Go have a look at `app/Laravel/Interfaces` to find out more about larapress services. ;-)

__All larapress services are available via Facade calls.__

No worries more complex services that are likely to be used in your custom code will of course be extensively documented here.
